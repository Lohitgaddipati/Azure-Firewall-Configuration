My portfolio shines with a significant achievement in network fortification and access control through the successful deployment and configuration of Azure Standard Firewall.

 I meticulously orchestrated each facet of this project, harnessing the full capabilities of Azure to create a robust security infrastructure. The process commenced with a strategic firewall deployment, thoughtfully tailored to accommodate fluctuating network traffic patterns. 

I then crafted precise application rules, ensuring the web server's essential outbound access. In parallel, I established network rules to facilitate critical DNS access. 

Additionally, I implemented NAT rules, offering secure remote access for web development purposes. Furthermore, by configuring Threat Intelligence to alert and deny potential threats, I bolstered network defenses with proactive threat mitigation. 

This multi-tasked endeavor reflects my proficiency in network security, firewall configuration, and threat management, underscoring my readiness to contribute to organizations seeking top-tier security solutions.
